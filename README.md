# Advanced Fallout Shelter Viewer

Demo --> [Fallout Shelter Viewer](https://jake1164.github.io/ShelterViewer/) <--

The goal of this project is to make it easier to track and organize dwellers and rooms in a larger Fallout Shelter game. I will be adding additional views that will let you sort and filter dwellers as well as view more specifics.

This is not intended as a cheat, as such I do not have intentions of leveling up dwellers stats, adding consumables, etc.  In a future version I was hoping to allow moving dwellers between room (optomizing levels), changing armour / outfits, maybe grouping or marking in some way the best Wasteland wanders. 

Currently this is in the beginning stages, however, it can be accessed via the [Shelter Viewer](https://jake1164.github.io/ShelterViewer/) page.

I am using the decryptor from http://fossd.bitballoon.com/ and inspiration from [shelter-editor](https://github.com/rakion99/shelter-editor).
